        <p>The following is adopted from the template provided by the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Our-Company-Privacy-Policy.pdf">Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</a></p>
        <h2 id="contact-details">Contact details</h2>
        <p>Swansea Cyber Clinic is a website created and deployed by the Swansea Cyber Clinic team as a website for the project. This privacy policy explains how your personal data is collected when you interact with Swansea Cyber Clinic. The words ‘we’ and ‘our’ refer to the <a href="mailto:cyberclinic@swansea.ac.uk">Swansea Cyber Clinic</a>.</p>

        <p>As of this revision of the data-protection policy, no data is collected, so this is a rather moot point. But the following will still be true if any personal data is collected in future (the privacy policy will be updated in that case).</p>
        <p>We would like to make sure you are fully aware of all your data protection rights. Every user is entitled to the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The right to access — You have the right to request copies of your personal data. We may charge you a small fee for this service.</li>
        <li>The right to rectification — You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request us to complete the information you believe is incomplete.</li>
        <li>The right to erasure — You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
        <li>The right to restrict processing — You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
        <li>The right to object to processing — You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
        <li>The right to data portability — You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:cyberclinic@swansea.ac.uk">cyberclinic@swansea.ac.uk</a>.</p>
