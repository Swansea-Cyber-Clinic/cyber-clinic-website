ONS (2020) estimates that volumes of fraud and computer misuse (e.g. hacking) approximate all other crime combined. These crimes lead to financial losses and impacts on health and wellbeing (Button & Cross 2017). Additionally, tech now plays a role in gender-based violence (Harris & Vitis 2020) and hate crime (Perry & Olsson 2009, Williams et al. 2020). As such, crimes are increasingly ‘hybrid’, taking place both online and offline. However, the victim response to online harms has been shown to be inconsistent, particularly with respect to identifying vulnerable victims (Skidmore et al. 2020) and addressing repeat victimisation (Correia 2020). In parallel, victim support services vary widely across geographical areas and the extent to which they are equipped to respond to the role of digital tech is ill understood.
